    blog: "Lago Di Carezza is the most beautiful lake in Dolomites, South Tyrol, well at least in my opinion. The water of emerald which sparkle magnificently with the flecks of a rainbow are completely mesmerizing and to fall in love with this place is pretty easy. Visit this place in sunrise or sunset is definitely a magical time. The lake itself small, though the size doesn't really matter as it still beats all the other lakes and by the way swimming there is prohibited. As I've heard, this wondrous place changed from the last time I've visited which was in 2013. In late 2018, a massive storm tore through Northern Italy along other countries. There were winds of more than 200km/h that ruined many forests. Lots of trees were fallen or cut which apparently caused more destruction and earnest consequences for its ecosystem. It will take a long time to fully recover from that storm. I wish there won't be anymore damage to this marvelous place that I love very much and hopefully I'll visit soon.",

Just the day we arrived, we already went for a boat/cruise sailing in Dubai River at eve including wonderful dinner, great music, company but most of all great scenery. Dubai has a lot to offer, a lot to see and experience, a lot to explore and feel, from the magnificent viewpoint at Burj Khalifa that is known for being the world's tallest building, to Dubai gorgeous marina, the 360 deg panoramic view at the Palm Observatory, to the gorgeus Dubai desert and yes it is gorgeous beauty of sand that I love. Reaching by the train above water at some part, to the magnificent Palm Jumeirah island, it's the time when you just can't stop rubbing your eyes because of the view around you and mainly because this luxory hotel and obviously not cheap lol.",

Sirmione which also refers to as 'the pearl of the islands and peninsulas', is a famous thermal destination that has a lovely spas to unwind and relax. This town has a lot to offer from strolling the hisorical streets of Sirmione, visiting Scaliger Castle and spending time at the beach behind the castle, to take a boat tour around Sirmione peninsula and swimming at Jamaica beach. You probably wondering why this beach name's not located in Jamaica or maybe I was mistaken, but no this beach indeed named like this because of its white rocks that will give you the feeling of being on a Caribbean island, it's very calm and clean beach with dainty brown sand which good for children's games and building castles. You should spend a day at Gardaland amusement park and trust me it is worth it. To sum it up, Sirmione is a magical place that definitely worth a visit, gorgeous vistas, historical streets and castles, incredible beaches and attractions all around, marvelous food and don't forget to enjoy their ice cream it's one of the best you'll ever taste in my opinion at least. Let's not forget about the people themselves the locals, really kind and wonderful people, always willing to help, happy and respectful. Viva Italia ! Arrivederci",

I haven't had the chance to travel in Japan yet, but my parents had the pleasure of doing so, and also taking this amazing photo while visiting this mesmerizing zen. This complex, whose gardens and architecture focused around a central Golden Pavilion, was built to evoke paradise on earth and was the destination of such esteemed visitors as Emperor Gokomatsu and is a popular tourist destination. You may wonder just like I was if Kinkaku-Ji is made of real gold, and indeed it is pure gold. It made of gold leaf and in order to stretch it as much as possible, copper and a small portion of silver are mixed into a pure gold. It was said that people can't touch it by hand without causing any cracks. I probably wouldn't have been able to take my eyes off of it haha, though this fragile thinness is what creates a true beauty unlike others when used on items such as decoration or lacquerware.

    blog: "Oh my Venezia.. How I miss you.. Such a special place to visit and live. Rio di San Felice name comes from the church located nearby. Venezia changed a lot since the last time I've been there, It became too crowded with travelers about every day depending on the season, but yes. Once the heart of a powerful maritime republic, Venice's main island has lost more than 120,000 residents since the early 1950s, driven away by myriad issues but mainly a focus on mass tourism that has caused the population to be dwarfed by the thousands of visitors who crowd its squares, bridges and narrow walkways each day. These include the increasing cost of living, overcrowded transportation systems, the lack of well-paid job opportunities, retail stores being replaced by tourist souvenir shops, and rising housing costs as tourists compete for accommodation with locals. The Venetians started to fight back, a new tourist tax has been introduced to help their city including daily tourist tax and hotel city tax. I really hope it'll change for the better for the locals.
